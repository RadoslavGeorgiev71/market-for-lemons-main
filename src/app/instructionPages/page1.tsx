            In total, you will complete 30 rounds. Each round, you will choose between either
            (1) making the prediction yourself or (2) choosing an AI system to make the prediction for you.
            You can choose from 10 different AI systems, as shown in the screenshot below.

                    The AI systems all look the same, but can differ in their average prediction performance. To make good predictions, an AI system must exhibit:

                <p>1. High accuracy in test data and</p>
                <p>2. High training data quality.</p>

                    If an AI system has both of these features, it has a probability of <strong>90%</strong> to make a correct prediction. 
                    If an AI system does not have both of these features, it has a probability of <strong>15%</strong> to make a correct prediction.

                    You cannot observe the features of any AI system. You only know that some AI systems have both features and therefore a probability of <strong>90%</strong> to make a correct prediction, 
                    and some AI systems do not have both features and therefore a probability of <strong>15%</strong> to make a correct prediction.

                <p>
                    The actual share of AI systems that provide good prediction performance is <strong>constant across all 30 rounds, irrespective of the specific task.</strong>

                    Furthermore, after each round, the pool of 10 AI systems refreshes. This means that each round, you see a new set of AI systems. 
                    Therefore, if you choose an AI system in any round and observe its performance, you cannot choose that AI system again. 
                    You can, however, learn about the overall share of high-performing and low-performing AI systems after choosing an AI system.
