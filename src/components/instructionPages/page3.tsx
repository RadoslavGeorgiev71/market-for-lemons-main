After <strong>Rounds 4 and 9</strong> of each task, you’ll be asked to <strong>state your beliefs</strong> about the proportion of low-quality AI systems in the pool. This means you’ll provide your beliefs <strong>six times in total</strong> — <strong>twice per task</strong>.</p>
        <p>Although the set of 10 AI systems changes every round, the <strong>overall share of low-quality AI systems remains constant</strong> across all 30 rounds. This allows you to <strong>learn from your experience</strong> and refine your beliefs over time.</p>
        <p>In addition to estimating the share of low-quality AI systems, you’ll also be asked to express your <strong>trust in the market</strong>.</p>
