        <p>Reminder: While you see 10 new AI systems each round, the share of low-quality AI systems remains the same across all 30 rounds. Therefore, you can learn from your experience with the AIs.</p>
        <p>In addition to stating your beliefs about the share of low-quality AI systems, you will also state your trust in the market.</p>
